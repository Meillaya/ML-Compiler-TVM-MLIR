# ML Compiler Development (TVM, MLIR)

This project aims to build a simple compiler for machine learning workloads, exploring concepts in compiler design, intermediate representations, and hardware-specific optimizations.

## Goals

- Build a simple compiler pass to optimize ML workloads (e.g., operator fusion, memory layout optimization).
- Gain experience with intermediate representation (IR) manipulation using TVM and MLIR.
- Learn about auto-tuning for hardware backends.
- Integrate the compiler with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

### Advanced Extensions

- Target a custom accelerator (e.g., a Cerebras-like architecture).
- Compare the performance of compiled code against hand-tuned kernels.
